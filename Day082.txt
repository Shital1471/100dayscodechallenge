                                                                            Climbing the Leaderboard

Question:
An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:

The player with the highest score is ranked number 1 on the leaderboard.
Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.
Example
ranked=[100,90,90,80]
player=[70,80,105]

The ranked players will have ranks 1,2 ,2 , and 3, respectively. If the player's scores are 70,80 and 105, their rankings after each game are 4th,3rd  and 1st. Return [4,3,1].

Function Description

Complete the climbingLeaderboard function in the editor below.

climbingLeaderboard has the following parameter(s):

int ranked[n]: the leaderboard scores
int player[m]: the player's scores
Returns

int[m]: the player's rank after each new score
Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of players on the leaderboard.
The next line contains n space-separated integers ranked[i], the leaderboard scores in decreasing order.
The next line contains an integer,m, the number games the player plays.
The last line contains m space-separated integers player[j], the game scores.

Constraints
1<=n<=2*10^5
1<=m<=2*10^5
0<=ranked[i]<=10^9 for 0<=i<n
0<=player[j]<=10^9 for 0<=j<m 
The existing leaderboard, ranked , is in descending order.
The player's scores, player , are in ascending order.
Subtask

For 60% of the maximum score:
1<=n<=200
1<=m<=200
Sample input:
7
100 100 50 40 40 20 10
4
5 25 50 120
output:
6
