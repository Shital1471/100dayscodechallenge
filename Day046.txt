Question:
You are given a class Solution and an inner class Inner.Private. The main method of class Solution takes an integer num  as input. The powerof 2 in class Inner.Private checks whether a number is a power of . You have to call the method powerof2 of the class Inner.Private from the main method of the class Solution.

Constraints
1<=num<=2^30
Sample Input

8
Sample Output

8 is power of 2
An instance of class: Solution.Inner.Private has been created
